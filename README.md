# Monte-Carlo-simulation
This repository provides an implementation of a Monte Carlo Simulation. Monte Carlo methods are widely used for solving problems in various fields, such as finance, physics, engineering, and more. The simulation uses random sampling to estimate numerical results and is particularly useful for modeling systems with inherent uncertainty.

# Features
- Customizable Parameters: Define your simulation parameters, such as number of iterations, probability distributions, and variables.
- Extensible Framework: Easily adapt the code to different types of problems.
- Visualization: Generate visual representations of the simulation results (histograms).

# Use Cases - 
- Risk assessment in financial portfolios
- Estimation of probabilities in complex systems
- Simulation of physical phenomena
- Decision-making under uncertainty
